This is a program designed to make doing pushups more fun.

People are divided into teams.  As the do pushups they gain points for their team.  Once their team has enough points, the team can move closer to the finish.

To  setup place the PHP files into a directory on your web server.
Configure the config.ini.php file to connect to your mysql/mariadb server and set a salt.
In the setup folder is a database.sql file.  Use this to create all the tables that you need for the competition.

As this program is still in the very early stages, you will need to place people into teams by directly modifying the database.

More features to come in the future!
