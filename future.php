<h1>Future Ideas</h1><br>


Here are things people have suggested to me:<p>

Boss fights.  When you land on a specific tile, you have a set period of time (example 24 hours) to do a certain number  of pushups within that time period. - Mike<br>
<i>It is possible, but will take some extra coding to get it to work</i><p>

<b>Implemented:</b> More obvious who your team is on the main Page - YenPeng<p>

Ability to join a team straight away from registration page - YenPeng<br>
<i>Looking at ways to improve this.  Want to vet all new players, but agree signup need to be streamlined more</i><p>

Random bomb tile.  When you land on a tile, it is revelead to be a bomb and sends you back to the start. - Andy<br>
<i>Should be easier to program.  However back to start is a little harsh.  Maybe a random trap tile that means you need to do more pushups than exptected to move on.</i><p>

<b>Implemented:</b> A time limit to stop people spamming pushups into the system<br>
<i>introduced a limit of 1 pushup entry per 5 minutes.</i><p>

<b>Implemented:</b> Better explanation of what the rules of the competition are, what the aim of the game is etc.  Make this clear on the main page - Hana<br>
<i>Created a help page, and also a pushup help page that is linked when you go to put in pushups.</i><p>

<b>Implemented:</b>The ability to like somebody's workout.  (Chear and motivate your team mates) - YenPeng.<br>
<i>This has been implemented in a simplistic form for now.  Will want to expand upon this in future versions.</i>
